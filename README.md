# About Me
My name is Patrick Schools and I am a senior at Washington and Lee University. I am studying engineering and computer science and am hoping to pursue graduate level research after graduation. 

# Academic Interests
Academically, I am interested in physics and engineering (sorry comp sci). I enjoy building rockets and making things go really fast. I am currently hoping to build a new competition rocket with the W&L rocketry club. 

# Hobbies
Outside of academics, I really enjoy listening to music. I like rock and bluegrass. Recently, I have been on a bit of a Widespread Panic kick. Prof. Tolley said that Widespread Panic fans don't shower. But he is a Billy Strings fan, and you know who Billy Strings likes? That's right, Widespread Panic. # Schoolsp25
